 This is a modified solution to the Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts website project on Codecademy. 
 
 Original spec: https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg.
 
 I designed and created, in Illustrator, the company logo and the contact icons. Codecademy provided the other images, and the social media icons come from https://fontawesome.com.
